### How to cite

Please cite this compendium as:

> Cascalheira, J., Horta, P., Bicho, N. (2018). *Compendium of R code
> and data for ‘The role of lithic bipolar technology in Western
> Iberia’s Upper Paleolithic: the case of Vale Boi (southern
> Portugal)’*. Accessed 07 Oct 2018. Online at
> <https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WPXGH>

### How to download or install

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:

<https://github.com/jmcascalheira/ScaledPiecesVB/archive/master.zip>

This repository is organized as an R package using rrtools by Ben
Marwick which can be installed from github with:

To download the package source as you see it on GitHub, for offline
browsing, use this line at the shell prompt (assuming you have Git
installed on your computer):

``` r

git clone https://github.com/jmcascalheira/ScaledPiecesVB.git
```

Once the download is complete, open the ScaledPieces.Rproj in RStudio to
begin working with the package and compendium files.

The package has a number of dependencies on other R packages, and
programs outside of R. Installing these can be time-consuming and
complicated, so we’ve included a packrat directory, which contains the
source code for all the packages we depend on. If all works well, these
will be installed on your computer when you open ScaledPiecesVB.Rproj in
RStudio.
